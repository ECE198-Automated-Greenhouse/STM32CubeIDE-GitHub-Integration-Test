# STM32CubeIDE-GitHub-Integration-Test
Credits: Shady Electronics
This Repository is made to test the capabilities of GitHub when using the STM32CubeIDE. 
For this project I followed [this tutorial](https://shadyelectronics.com/how-to-use-github-with-stm32cubeide/).

### Notes
- When STM32CubeIDE asks for username and password (this happens during the commiting process), use your GitHub username for the username, and use your GitHub Token for the password.
